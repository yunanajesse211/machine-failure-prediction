# machine-failure-prediction
This project develops a machine learning model for predicting if an industrial machine would likely break down or not based on properties such as temperature, torque, and the force among others applied on the machine while working. This project utilised 3 machine learning classification algorithms which are support vector machine, logistic regression and bagging algorithm
